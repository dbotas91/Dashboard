### **New Yorker Articles**

- **[Between the Lines](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/29/between-the-lines)**
    
    "One idea is key: Kandinsky’s proposition that a line is a point set in motion. Analogies between drawing and movement play tag throughout a show of wildly multifarious works."
    

- **[Goings on About Town](https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/atea-nature-and-divinity-in-polynesia)**
    
    "Though Kandinsky is widely credited with inventing abstract painting, art history has generally sided with Malevich, whose “Black Square” threw down the gauntlet for nonobjective painting in 1915. That work (which is not on view) provoked Kandinsky to produce the flip response “In the Black Square,” which he painted in 1923."
